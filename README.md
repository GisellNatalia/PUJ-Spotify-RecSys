# Spotify Recommender System
This project aims to build a song recommendation system from Spotify data. We used two datasets, one for songs and the other for artists, which were cleaned and stored in PostgreSQL and BigQuery.

## Team Members
Gisell Natalia Cristiano Mu√±oz & Manuel Andres Paz Castillo

## Data
The datasets used in this project were obtained from the Spotify API and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1toW8fa6ag4oNU00RuJHVUwhwEqmMsJaZ). 

## Implemented Components
The project consists of three installments, each with a specific objective:
1. Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.
2. Construction of an ETL process to automate the transformation and loading of data to PostgreSQL and BigQuery.
3. Construction of a dashboard with two indicators and three graphs. Creation of a machine learning model (KNN algorithm) and construction of a API REST to recommend songs from an entered song.

## How to use the repository
Each component is located in a separate folder at the root of the repository. Inside each folder is a README file that details the steps for its execution and deployment.
