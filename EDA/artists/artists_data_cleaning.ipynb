To achieve this goal, a data cleaning process will be performed that will address the problems identified in the exploratory data analysis notebook (artists_data_analysis.ipynb). This cleaning process will be based on the detection and correction of null values, outliers, errors, and duplicates.\n",

This second exploratory data analysis will be used to validate the cleaned data and detect any additional problems that may have arisen during the cleaning process. The cleaning process is divided into several stages, including:\n",
